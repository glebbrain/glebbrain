# Gleb Karpov

Independent software engineer and systems architect focused on automation, orchestration, and agent-driven AI workflows.

I build long-running engineering systems where AI is integrated directly into the development architecture — supporting design, refactoring, validation, and reproducibility.

---

## Focus Areas

- Agentic AI development workflows
- Automation and RPA platforms
- Orchestration and system architecture
- AI-assisted tooling for complex, multi-project environments

---

## AI-Driven Engineering Practice

In 2025, Cursor published aggregated usage statistics for its development platform.

According to these statistics, my account is ranked within the **Top 2% of users globally**.

This reflects a sustained, structured use of AI as part of my core engineering workflow:
- agent-driven development processes
- AI-assisted system design and refactoring
- automated validation and consistency checks
- coordinated work across dozens of active projects

AI is used as an embedded component of the architecture, not as a standalone tool.

## Selected Public Projects

> Note: Some projects are currently in early-stage or pre-MVP status.  
> Public repositories represent selected artifacts, core components, or architectural foundations.

- **FreeRPA** — open automation and RPA platform (pre-MVP, architecture & core tooling)
- **Manager / Automation Tooling** — internal agent orchestration and workflow automation (public subset)
- **AI Engineering Artifacts** — architecture notes, diagrams, and experiments
- **Open MIT Projects** — reusable libraries and utilities

(Links will be added and expanded as projects mature.)

---

## Roadmap

- Finalize MVP architecture for core automation platform (2026)
- Expand public documentation and architectural artifacts
- Release initial production-ready components
- Continue development of agent-based engineering tooling
